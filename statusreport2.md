Week's Accomplishments:
	- Improved algorithm, so it doesn't just have placeholder variables, spits
	  out a final number, and better balance (more regularity in number output)
	- Bootstrapped front end built
	- Algorithm linked to front-end

Challenges and Issues This Week:
	- Finding time to meet as a group
	- Using the Facebook API (it's a mess, but we want to use it for friends,
	  not just as a login tool)

Goals for Next Week:
	- Facebook for login/friends lists
	- Build database with friends & personal data (each data point of hipster
	  score, time, person)
