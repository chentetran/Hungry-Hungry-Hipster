This is just a written draft of the algorithm; the code will come later. 

Factors to take into account:
-Number of reviews
-List of set restaurants (Top100Restaurants.xlsx); if you're on it, you're getting docked
-Bonus Points if certain tags are present; points removed if other tags are present. All bonuses are forfeit if on the list of top 100 restaurants. Add a factor to increase the bonus (or penalty) if it has multiple bonus (or penalty) tags. Ideas for bonus points: csa, ethnicgrocery, ethnicmarkets, farmersmarket, foodtrucks, internetcafe, kombucha, organic_stores, healthmarkets, streetvendors, vegan, vegetarian. Ideas to remove points: convenience, grocery, tradamerican (slight deduction), italian (slight deduction) cafeteria, hotdogs (tag for fast food).
