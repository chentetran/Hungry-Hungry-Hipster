This is a draft of our "hipsterness" algorithm; the code will come later. 

-----------------------------------------------------

FACTORS:
-Number of reviews, as compared to the average in the search area
-Any restaurant on the list of 100 highest earning chain restaurants will have a negative base score (see sources at the bottom).
-Bonus Points if certain tags are present; penalty if other tags are present. Bonus (or penalty) increased if the restaurant has multiple bonus (or penalty) tags.
-Bonus multiplier if the restaurant has no previous reviews.
-Penalties decreased if there aren't any other options in the area.
-Penalty if a user has recently visited a restaurant. TEAM MEMBERS: we'd just have to store the last x restaurant ids and see if any match the current id. Shouldn't be too big a deal.

-----------------------------------------------------

********PRELIMINARY ALGORITHM********

BASE SCORE:
if (on list of 100 chains)
	base_score = -sqrt(101 - rank on list)

//base score boost if fewer reviews than other nearby restaurants
else if (number of reviews != 0 && average number of reviews of restaurants in the search area != 0)
	base_score = 10 / (number of reviews / average number of reviews of restaurants in the search area)
else
	base_score = 10

PENALTIES:
/*penalty tags (subject to change): convenience, grocery, tradamerican, italian, pizza, chinese, cafeteria, hotdogs (tag for fast food)*/

//Tags
if (one penalty tag)
	penalty = 5
else if (two or more penalty tags)
	penalty = 10
else
	penalty = 0

/*Location multiplier (to be tweaked depending on search area). The idea being, if it's not a hipster place and it's your only option, you lose significantly less points. Why? 1) You're probably a little off the beaten path anyways, or you wouldn't have found it, and 2) It seems unfair to heavily penalize those without as many options.*/
if (only restaurant in search area)
	penalty = penalty / 4

//Not sure if we're keeping enough info for this one yet:
if (you visited recently)
	forfeit base score if it's > 0
	penalty = 5 //ignore other penalties

BONUS POINTS:
/*bonus tags (subject to change): csa, ethnicgrocery, ethnicmarkets, farmersmarket, foodtrucks, internetcafe, kombucha, organic_stores, healthmarkets, streetvendors, vegan, vegetarian*/

//Tags
if (one bonus tag)
	bonus = 5
else if (two bonus tags)
	bonus = 10
else if (three or more bonus tags)
	bonus = 20 
else
	bonus = 0

/*No review bonus; it could just be a new place, but the more hipster it is already, the sweeter having no reviews is.*/
if (no reviews)
	bonus = bonus * 1.5

TOTAL SCORE:
total score = base score + bonus - penalty
