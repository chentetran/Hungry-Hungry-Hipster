#Hungry Hungry Hipster

Humans are creatures of habit. Especially when it comes to food, if we find a restaurant we like, we will swear by it. 

While familiarity breeds comfort, an unchanging diet has certain health and wellbeing repercussions. A lack of dietary variety means a lack of necessary nutrients. A monotonous diet means a monotonous lifestyle. As Winston Churchill once said, “To improve is to change. To perfect is to change often.” This very well applies to dietary habits.

Hungry Hungry Hipster aims to incentivize the modern generation to eat healthier and adventure more--to push themselves out of their comfort zone. The app rewards users with points for visiting new and lesser-known restaurants, and punishes users by deducting points when they fall back into their dietary rut.

When the user logs into Hungry Hungry Hipster, they will be prompted to check in at a nearby restaurant. Nearby restaurants are determined by geolocation and are displayed to the user for quick and easy checkins. 

Hungry Hungry Hipster uses the Yelp API and our own algorithm to calculate the amount of points to reward or deduct from the user. The more popular a restaurant is, which is correlated with number of Yelp reviews, the less points are awarded. Certain overly popular, “mainstream” shops, such as Starbucks, even deduct points. As such, it is the user’s best interest to visit lesser known restaurants to accrue a higher “hipster”-score. Reaching certain score benchmarks will also result in badges, furthering encouraging users to visit new restaurants and earn shinier badges.

After checking in, a user will then see a chart of their points earned from previous checkins so that they can monitor their hipster score. This chart, created by using the Google Charts API, provides insight on their dietary habits and illustrates their journey to become the ultimate hipster.

And while humans are creatures of habit, we are also very social creatures. This time, we seek to encourage that by giving the user the option to compare their hipster-score with a specific friend from Facebook, and see their overall score relative to every other Hungry Hungry Hipster user.
